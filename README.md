## Hi there 👋 

### About Me ✨
My name is Yasmin Aguilar and I currently work as a Software QA Analyst! I am trying to build up my Github and refresh my coding skills to move over to an Software Developer in Test (SDET) role. 😄

### Fun Facts❗
  - I am a Libra♎
  - I work from home, so I live like a vampire (never see the sunlight)🧛
  - I have 2 cats (Maggie and Cookie)🐈‍⬛
